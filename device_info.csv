dummy,"Dummy sensor basics","Dummy sensors are virtual numerical sensors used for testing and benchmarking the SCADA UI. Each dummy sensor has a Normal baseline value defined in the system. Under healthy conditions, readings usually stay relatively close to this Normal value.\n\nExample normal/GOOD patterns when Normal ≈ 10:\n- [9.8, 10.1, 9.9, 10.3, 10.0]\n- [10.2, 9.7, 10.4, 9.9]\n- Occasional single NA such as [10.0, 10.1, NA, 9.9] can still be compatible with normal behaviour if most values are stable near Normal."
wind_speed,"Wind speed sensor basics","The wind_speed device_type measures wind speed in meters per second (m/s). In this demo, typical normal operating values are often in the 0–30 m/s range, with relatively smooth changes over time.\n\nExample normal/GOOD patterns:\n- [3.2, 3.5, 4.0, 3.8, 4.1] (light wind, small variations)\n- [7.0, 8.2, 9.1, 8.7, 9.0] (moderate wind with smooth changes)\n- [0.0, 0.2, 0.1, 0.0] (calm conditions near zero)\n- A sequence like [5.0, 5.2, NA, 5.1] with a single NA among otherwise stable values can still be consistent with normal behaviour."
wind_dir,"Wind direction sensor basics","The wind_dir device_type measures wind direction in degrees from 0 to 360. Valid normal readings are within this interval, and direction can change gradually over time.\n\nExample normal/GOOD patterns:\n- [10, 20, 25, 15, 30] (slow changes in direction)\n- [350, 5, 15, 355] (wrap-around near 0/360 is normal)\n- [90, 95, 100, 110] (stable direction with slight drift)\n- A pattern like [120, 125, NA, 130] with one NA mixed into otherwise valid angles can still reflect normal behaviour."
inside_temp,"Inside temperature sensor basics","The inside_temp device_type represents indoor air temperature in degrees Celsius. Typical comfortable indoor conditions are around 18–28 °C, with only slow changes over time as heating or cooling adjusts.\n\nExample normal/GOOD patterns:\n- [21.5, 22.0, 21.8, 22.2, 21.9] (stable around room temperature)\n- [19.0, 20.0, 21.0, 22.0] (gradual warming as heating turns on)\n- [24.0, 23.8, 24.2, 24.1] (slight fluctuations around a setpoint)\n- A series such as [22.0, 22.1, NA, 21.9] with one missing value among otherwise normal readings can still be consistent with GOOD operation."
outside_temp,"Outside temperature sensor basics","The outside_temp device_type represents outdoor air temperature in degrees Celsius. Plausible normal values depend on climate and season, but moderate temperatures with gradual changes over time are typically considered normal.\n\nExample normal/GOOD patterns:\n- [5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 5.8] (cool but normal outdoor conditions)\n- [18.0, 19.0, 20.0, 19.5] (mild weather with small variations)\n- [-5.0, -4.0, -4.5, -4.2] (typical cold winter conditions in some regions)\n- A sequence like [10.0, 10.3, NA, 10.1] with a single NA among otherwise reasonable temperatures can still be regarded as normal."
